"drift-toolkit": patch
---

Fix multiple bug issues:

- **#108**: Fix dependency change detection failing with shallow clones by increasing clone depth from 1 to 2
- **#101**: Show "repo not found" error instead of "missing required files" when scanning a non-existent repository
- **#100**: Add TOML validation for check.toml files to report parse errors instead of silently succeeding
